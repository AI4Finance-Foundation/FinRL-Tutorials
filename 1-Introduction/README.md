We provide tutorials for simple tasks.


### **1. Stock**

We demonstrate a full pipeline of a stock trading task in [NeurIPS 2018 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07522).

The three notebooks: **Stock_NeurIPS2018_Data.ipynb**, **Stock_NeurIPS2018_Train.ipynb**, **Stock_NeurIPS2018_Backtest.ipynb** showcase a workflow of applying ML/RL in algorithmic trading.

Once you are familiar with the above three files, feel free to run the notebook ****Stock_NeurIPS2018_SB3.ipynb** and **Stock_NeurIPS2018_ElegantRL.ipynb** that follow a similar process to play with different RL libraries.


### **2. Portfolio Allocation**

The notebook **FinRL_PortfolioAllocation_NeurIPS_2020.ipynb** shows how to use FinRL do the classic task of portfolio allocation. 

**FinRL_PortfolioAllocation_NeurIPS_2020.py** is a single python file that contains all the codes.


### **3. China A share**

**China_A_share_market_tushare.ipynb** demonstrates how to trade on China A share market. We connect with the Tushare library to fetch data from China A share market.


### **4. Stock Fundamental**

**Stock_Fundamental.ipynb** shows the process of training a deep reinforcement learning agent with companies’ fundamental indicators.

**China_A_share_market_tushare.py** is a single python file that contains all the codes.


### **5. Forex Trading**

**ForexTrading_Demo.ipynb** gives the process of foreign exchange market trading.

**ForexTrading_Demo.py** is a single python file that contains all the codes.
